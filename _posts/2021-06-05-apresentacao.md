### üáßüá∑üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüññ [Alola!](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Alola#Etymology) Hi! :)



I'm an Electrical Engineering MSc and Control and Automation Engineer, graduated from the [Institute of Science and Technology of Sorocaba (ICTS UNESP)](https://www.sorocaba.unesp.br). 

üîé  My master's dissertation is titled ["Aprendizado sens√≥rio-motor em rob√¥s cognitivos utilizando o modelo CST-CONAIM" ("Sensorimotor learning in cognitive robots using the CST-CONAIM model")](https://repositorio.unesp.br/items/44b01535-491b-418c-94cf-0634654049c2). 

üèÜ My master's dissertation [won the first place in the Robotics Thesis and Dissertations Competition](https://jornal.unesp.br/2022/11/17/pesquisa-premiada-busca-criar-inteligencia-artificial-capaz-de-reproduzir-etapas-de-aprendizagem-de-crianca/?fbclid=IwAR1NmsVcOo_0W-xSc8ybmjLvpio0vepLKfKyLc_yEDiOlUCpiJZMhmlI_0k), 2022 edition, with the work ["Aprendizado procedimental e sens√≥rio-motor em rob√¥s cognitivos" ("Procedural and sensorimotor learning in cognitive robots")](https://doi.org/10.5753/wtdr_ctdr.2022.227371). 

‚ô¶Ô∏è We also had a published paper: ["Learning over the Attentional Space with Mobile Robots"](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDL-EpiRob48136.2020.9278119).



I am currently a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at the [Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC/UNICAMP)](https://www.fee.unicamp.br). 

üí≠ I'm member of the [Cognitive Architectures area](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/research-areas/arquiteturas-cognitivas/) at [H.IAAC (Hub of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures)](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/students/), which aims the development and dissemination of technologies capable of integrating intelligence resources in mobile devices, making them able to take decisions. 

‚ô¶Ô∏è Recently, we had a published paper: ["Piagetian experiments to DevRobotics"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2023.101170).


ü§ñ My research areas involve Automation, Cognitive Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

My Curriculum Lattes is [http://lattes.cnpq.br/7488267373775314](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7488267373775314).

I am also an organization member at [RoboCup Brasil](https://www.robocup.org.br/wp/quem-somos/), helping to organize national educational robotics events in Brazil:
* [Brazilian Robotics Olympiad (OBR)](https://www.obr.org.br)

* [National Robotics Exhibition (MNR)](https://www.mnr.org.br)

* [Brazilian Robotics Competition (CBR) / Latin America Robotics Competition (LARC)](https://www.cbrobotica.org)
