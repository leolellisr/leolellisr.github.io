Repository of my personal page repository on Github. This repository houses the code for my personal website, showcasing my projects, portfolio, and more.


This template was not made entirely from scratch. I'd like to give special thanks to wandgibaut, Jekyll Now and Bootstrap Clean Blog.

I'd also like to thank Jekyll Themes for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.
