PhD project page. CogScore - An Online Evaluation Playground For Cognitive Architectures With Developmental Robotics. This work aims to present a general framework for the automated evaluation of different levels of diverse cognitive capabilities of cognitive architectures.

This template was not made entirely from scratch. I'd like to give special thanks to wandgibaut, Jekyll Now and Bootstrap Clean Blog.

I'd also like to thank Jekyll Themes for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.
