  Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_University_of_Campinas">Unicamp</a> working currently working as a researcher in industry in the field of artificial intelligence.
  Here you can find information about my work and about some small personal projects.

  This page is a work in progress, so please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Also, it's been difficult to alocate time to update the blog (in portuguese), but I will be updating it soon.
